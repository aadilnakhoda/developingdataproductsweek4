- Checkboxes to let user choose reporting of certain output such as slope coefficient, fitted line and concluding statement.
- Shows a preview of the observations of mileage(mpg) and the car feature selected.

**The Reproducible Pitch Presentation:**
- It has 5 slides
- Contains relevant links to the *Shinyapps
- Contains the link to the Github repository hosting the ui.R and server.R files.
- Provides a peek into the structure of the dataset by running the str(mtcars) command.
- Reports a snippet of codes in ui.R and server.R available in the Github repository.
